This folder contains my public data of the great open source game "Red Eclipse".
Special things are written in the <Name>-ReadMe.txt which can be found in the most folders.

Because its easier for me to update this files with Google Drive, here are every time the newest versions.

In the GitHub directory are not every time the newest version, because i dont want to spam the GitHub repository with every small fix.
Furthermore GitHub has not all data (like screenshots and the REmapCollection). But i will try to update as fast as possible.
