Information about my folder
This folder contains my public data of the great open source game "Red Eclipse".
Special things are written in the "<Name>"-ReadMe.txt which can be found in the most folders. The "texture-ReadMe" is very important if you would like to handle some of the texture files.

For more stuff take a look at Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B__JdfXlvXlxRlpNVVRsOVdFSmM&usp=sharing (like screenshots and the REmapCollection).
