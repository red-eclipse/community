PLEASE NOTE: Health bar and impulsebar (RE-hud-impulsebg+impulse.svg) should be the "same" as possible! (but impulsebg is based on healthbg).

Furthermore the health.png needs a transparency, for this do:
1. follow the steps in the texture-ReadMe for making a RE styled icon
2. merge all (exluded the white image (which is still invisible)) levels to one and set the transparency of this new level to 90%
3. export it


Files:

RE-hud-healthbg+health.svg
- Main work data ONLY for editing (its not centered to the work area)


RE-hud-healthbg-export.svg
- Is the centered healthbg for making a RE style with it.

RE-hud-health-export.svg
- Is matched to health bar (healthbg-export) for making a RE style with it.

RE-hud-healthbg+health-export.svg
-Just both healthbg and health bar in one data.

The export data are edited for export them easily to a usefull RE style. Like distance between left/ right border (25px) and bottom/ down (12px) and merged parts.
