All .svg files are made myself (Iceflower) with Inkscape. (You can find the RE-style images of the Edit Icons too.) The .svg of some have done unnamed but these are NOT include (at the moment).
The file structure are the same as in the RE main directory. (Not the Edit Icons)

To edit and export you need: A Vector Programm like Inkscape (others are possible too) and GIMP and if you want them with a RE style you need the re-icon fu-script from unnamed.

To install the fu-script do this:
1. Donwload the fu-script (link below)
2. Copy it to the GIMP config directory (under Windows 7: C -> User -> "Your Username" -> .gimp-2.8 -> scripts)

To edit the vector data do this:
1. Install a vector programm you like to use
2. Read tutorials or learn by doing :D

To make a RE style icon do this:
1. Import the .svg with your wanted size in GIMP (just open it with GIMP)
3. If its necessary use "Colours" -> "Colour to Alpha" and choose black (html notation: 000000) to get only a white image with a transparency background
4. Use "Filters" -> "Alpha to Logo"
(5):!HINT!: Sometimes there are "name-part1.svg" and "name-part2.svg" here you need NOT the "name.svg" only the partX data, make them both to RE-style and combine them after it. (more 3D effect)
    (part1 then over it part2 and so on) Sometimes its possible that a part of the part need to cut and put over the other part (like in the AbstraktTeleporter). But be sure that all parts have the same size.
    In the "name.svg" are only both parts in one data.
6. Export as .png
